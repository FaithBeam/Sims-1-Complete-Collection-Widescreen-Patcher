## Requirements

* [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer)
* NoCD/Crack Sims Executable
  * This exe cannot be previously patched to a custom resolution. For example, if you downloaded a crack that was patched to 1080p, this program will not work.

## Usage

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/FaithBeam/Sims-1-Complete-Collection-Widescreen-Patcher/releases)
2. Extract everything from the zip
3. Run Sims1WidescreenPatcher.exe as administrator
4. Select your Sims.exe
5. Enter your preferred resolution
6. Click Patch
7. Run "The Sims...800x600" shortcut or create your own from Sims.exe

## Graphics Wrappers

You can select between two graphics wrappers, [DgVoodoo2](http://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/dgVoodoo2/) and [DDrawCompat](https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat). The short is they both fix graphical issues and improve performance. I recommend trying DDrawCompat first and if that doesn't work, try DgVoodoo2. If neither work, choose none.

**Note**
If you use DDrawCompat and are using a GSync monitor, your game will crash. Refer to this page for the fix: [DDrawCompat-GSync-Fix](https://github.com/FaithBeam/Sims-1-Complete-Collection-Widescreen-Patcher/wiki/DDrawCompat-GSync-Fix)

## Uninstall

If you want to go back to your original Sims executable, select the uninstall button.
